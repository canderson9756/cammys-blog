    <h2>A Short Story Me and This Blog</h2>
    <p>
        I am creating this blog to put my general thoughts and ideas and what I'm doing in my life.
        This is mostly just a reccord to myself but it will be made public. This is because, as well as being
        an exciting outlet to type what is coming to my mind (I can type faster than I can write),
        it is also a genuine project to learn better software develpment and web development.
        For this reason, I am going to try and massivley over engineer this with different users and proper hosting.
    </p>

    <p>
        As well as being a project for develping software, it is also going to be a project to develop and track the development
        of myself. This is my personal growth development and the tracking of the skills that matter to me. I will track my hopefull
        progression to a phd, my increases in ability in climbing, and different stories of the trips away up north I plan to do. As well as this, 
        there will also be general tales of my thouhgts like I'm doing here. This just works to 
        emalgamate the notes I have into one semi-cohesive idea.
    </p>

    <p>
        Anyway, that's enough of this for now. I hope you enjoy this future Cammy, and goodluck in your journey.
